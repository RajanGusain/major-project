Precision agriculture is in trend nowadays. Precision agriculture is a modern farming technique that
uses the data of soil characteristics, soil types, crop yield data, weather conditions and suggests the
farmers with the most optimal crop to grow in their farms for maximum yield and profit. This
technique can reduce the crop failures and will help the farmers to take informed decision about
their farming strategy. In order to mitigate the agrarian crisis in the current status quo, there is a
need for better recommendation systems to alleviate the crisis by helping the farmers to make an
informed decision before starting the cultivation of crops. A crop management system can provide
valuable insights into crop health and growth by collecting and analyzing data from various
sources, such as weather forecasts, soil sensors, and satellite imagery. This information can help
farmers make informed decisions about when to plant, irrigate, fertilize, and harvest their crops, as
well as identify and address potential issues such as pest infestations or nutrient deficiencies.
Moreover, crop management systems can be integrated with IoT devices such as drones, smart
irrigation systems, and weather stations. This can improve data collection and analysis, as well as
automate tasks such as irrigation and pest control. Therefore, we are building a machine learning
and deep-learning based website “FARMING 1.O” that recommends the best crop to grow,
fertilizers to use, and the diseases caught by your crops.
